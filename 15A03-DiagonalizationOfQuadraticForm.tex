A quadratic form may be diagonalized by the following procedure:
\begin{enumerate}
\item  Find a variable $x$ such that $x^2$ appears in the quadratic form.  If no such variable can be found, perform a linear change of variable so as to create such a variable.
\item  By completing the square, define a new variable $x'$ such that there are no cross-terms involving $x'$.
\item  Repeat the procedure with the remaining variables.
\end{enumerate}

{\bf Example}
Suppose we have been asked to diagonalize the quadratic form
 $$Q = x^2 + xy - 3xz - y^2/4 + yz - 9 z^2/4$$
in three variables.  We could proceed as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item  Since $x^2$ appears, we do not need to perform a change of variables.
\item  We have the cross terms $xy$ and $-3 xz$.  If we define $x' = x + y/2 - 3z/2$, then 
 $${x'}^2 = x^2 + xy - 3xz + y^2/4 + 9 z^2/4 - 3yz/2$$
Hence, we may re-express $Q$ as
 $$Q = {x'}^2 - yz/2$$
\item  We must now repeat the procedure with the remaining variables, $y$ and $z$.  Since neither $y^2$ nor $z^2$ appears, we must make a change of variable.  Let us define $z' = z + 2y$.
 $$Q = {x'}^2 - y^2 - yz'/2$$
\item  We have a cross term $- yz'/2$.  To eliminate this term, make a change of variable $y' = y + z'/4$.  Then we have
 $${y'}^2 = y^2 + yz'/2 + {z'}^2/16$$
and hence
 $$Q = {x'}^2 - {y'}^2 + {z'}^2/16$$
The quadratic form is now diagonal, so we are done.  We see that the form has rank 3 and signature 2.
