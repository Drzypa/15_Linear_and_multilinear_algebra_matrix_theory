A Z-matrix $A$ is called an \emph{M-matrix} if it satisfies any one of
the following equivalent conditions.


\begin{enumerate}

\item All principal minors of $A$ are positive.

\item The leading principal minors of $A$ are positive.

\item $A$ can be written in the form $A=kI-B$, where $B$ is a
non-negative matrix whose spectral radius is strictly less than
$k$.

\item All real eigenvalues of $A$ are positive.

\item The real part of any eigenvalue of $A$ is positive.

\item $A$ is non-singular and the inverse of $A$ is non-negative.

\item $Av \geq 0 $ implies $v\geq 0$.

\item There exists a vector $v$ with non-negative entries such
that $Av > 0$.

\item $A+D$ is non-singular for every non-negative diagonal matrix
$D$.

\item $A+kI$ is non-singular for all $k\geq 0$.

\item For each nonzero vector $v$, $v_i (Av)_i>0$ for some $i$.

\item There is a positive diagonal matrix $D$ such that the matrix
$DA + A^TD$ is positive definite.

\item $A$ can be factorized as $LU$, where $L$ is lower
triangular, $U$ is upper triangular, and the diagonal entries of
both $L$ and $U$ are positive.

\item The diagonal entries of $A$ are positive and $AD$ is
strictly diagonally dominant for some positive diagonal matrix
$D$.
\end{enumerate}
