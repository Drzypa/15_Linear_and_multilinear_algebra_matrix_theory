\begin{document}
Let $A$ be a square matrix of order $n$ with entries $a_{ij}$ 
which are real or complex.  
Then $A$ is said to be \emph{diagonally dominant} if 
$$|a_{ii}| \geq \sum^n_{j=1, j\neq i} |a_{ij}|$$ 
for $i$ from $1$ to $n$.\\  
In addition $A$ is said to be \emph{strictly diagonally dominant} if 
$$|a_{ii}| > \sum^n_{j=1, j\neq i}|a_{ij}|$$
 for $i$ from $1$ to $n$.\\
