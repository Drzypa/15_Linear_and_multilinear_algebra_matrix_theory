\begin{document}
Given an $m\times n$ matrix $A$ and an $1\times n$ real row vector $c$, both with real coefficients, one and only one of the following systems has a solution:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $Ax\leq 0$ and $cx > 0$ for some $n$-column vector $x$;
\item $wA = c$ and $w\geq 0$ for some $m$-row vector $w$.
\end{enumerate}
Equivalently, one and only one of the following has a solution:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $Ax\leq 0$, $x\leq 0$ and $cx>0$ for some $n$-column vector $x$;
\item $wA\leq c$ and $w\geq 0$ for some $m$-row vector $w$.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Remark.} Here, $Ax\geq 0$ means that every \PMlinkescapetext{component} of $Ax$ is nonnegative, and similarly with the other expressions.
