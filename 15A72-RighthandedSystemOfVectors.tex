\begin{document}
Three ordered non-coplanar vectors $\vec{u}$, $\vec{v}$ and $\vec{w}$, which have a common \PMlinkescapetext{initial point}, are said to form a {\em right-handed} or {\em dextral system} (Latin {\em dexter} = \PMlinkescapetext{`right'}), if a right-threaded screw rotated through an angle less than $180^{\rm{o}}$ from $\vec{u}$ to $\vec{v}$ will advance in the direction of $\vec{w}$.\, For instance, the usual basis vectors $\vec{i}$, $\vec{j}$ and $\vec{k}$ form a dextral system.
