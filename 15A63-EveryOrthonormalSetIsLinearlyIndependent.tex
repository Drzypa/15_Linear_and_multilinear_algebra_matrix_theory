{\bf Theorem }: An orthonormal set of vectors in an inner product space is linearly independent.

\emph{Proof.} We denote by $\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle$ the inner product of $L$.  Let $S$ be an orthonormal set of vectors.
Let us first consider the case when $S$ is finite, i.e.,
$S=\{e_1,\ldots, e_n\}$ for some $n$.
Suppose
$$ \lambda_1 e_1 + \cdots + \lambda_n e_n =0$$
for some scalars $\lambda_i$ (belonging to the field on the
underlying vector space of $L$). For a fixed $k$ in $1,\ldots, n$,
we then have
$$0=\langle e_k,0\rangle =  \langle e_k,\lambda_1 e_1 + \cdots + \lambda_n e_n \rangle = \lambda_1 \langle e_k,e_1\rangle + \cdots + \lambda_n \langle e_k,e_n\rangle = \lambda_k,$$

so $\lambda_k=0$, and $S$ is linearly independent.
Next, suppose $S$ is infinite (countable or uncountable). To prove
that $S$ is linearly independent, we need to show that
all finite subsets of $S$ are linearly independent. Since any
subset of an orthonormal set is also orthonormal, the infinite case
follows from the finite case. $\Box$
