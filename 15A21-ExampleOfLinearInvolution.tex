\begin{document}
Let $V$ be the vector space of $m\times n$ complex matrices.  Then the operator $L\colon A \mapsto A^H$, which takes a matrix $A\in V$ into its Hermitian conjugate $A^H \in V$ is an involution.  The projection operators induced by this involution decompose a matrix into a direct sum of Hermitian and skew-Hermitian matrices.
