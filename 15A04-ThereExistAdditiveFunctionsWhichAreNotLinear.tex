\begin{example}
There exists a function $f\colon \R\to\R$ which is additive but not linear.
\end{example}
\begin{proof}
Let $V$ be the infinite dimensional vector space $\R$ over the 
field $\Q$. Since $1$ and $\sqrt 2$ are two independent vectors in $V$, we can extend the set $\{1,\sqrt 2\}$ to a basis $E$ of $V$ (notice that here the axiom of choice is used).

Now we consider a linear function $f\colon V \to \R$ such that $f(1)=1$ while $f(e)=0$ for all $e\in E\setminus\{1\}$. This function is $\Q$-linear (i.e.\ it is additive on $\R$) but it is not $\R$-linear because $f(\sqrt 2)=0\neq \sqrt 2 f(1)$.
\end{proof}
