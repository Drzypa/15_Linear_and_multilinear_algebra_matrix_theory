Unlike the scalar logarithm, there are no naturally-defined bases for the matrix logarithm; therefore, the matrix logarithm is always taken to be the natural logarithm.  In general, there may be an infinite number of matrices $B$ satisfying $\exp(B)=A$; these are known as the logarithms of $A$.

As for the scalar natural logarithm, the matrix logarithm can be defined as a power series when $A$ is a square matrix and $\norm{I-A} < 1$, where $\norm{\cdot}$ is the Frobenius matrix norm.  The logarithm this formula produces is known as the \emph{principal logarithm} of $A$.
\begin{equation*}
\log(A) = -\sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{(I-A)^k}{k} =\log(I+X) = \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{(-1)^{k+1}}{k} X^k
\end{equation*}

Since this series expansion does not converge for all $A$, it is not a global inverse function for the matrix exponential.  In particular, $\exp^{\log A}=A$ only holds for $\norm{I-A} < 1$, and $\log(\exp^A)=A$ only holds for $\norm{A} < 2$.

There are other, more general methods of calculating the matrix logarithm.  For example, see \htmladdnormallink{An Explicit Formula for the Matrix Logarithm}{http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0410556}.
