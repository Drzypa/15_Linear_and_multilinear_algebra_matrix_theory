\begin{document}
Let $k$ be a field of characteristic not 2.  Then a quadratic form $Q$ over a vector space $V$ (over a field $k$) is said to be \PMlinkescapetext{\emph{non-degenerate}}, if its associated bilinear form:
$$B(x,y)=\frac{1}{2}(Q(x+y)-Q(x)-Q(y))$$
is non-degenerate.

If we fix a basis $\boldsymbol{b}$ for $V$, then $Q(x)$ can be written as 

$$Q(x)=x^TAx$$

for some symmetric matrix $A$ over $k$.  Then it's not hard to see that $Q$ is non-degenerate iff $A$ is non-singular.  Because of this, a non-degenerate quadratic form is also known as a \emph{non-singular} quadratic form.  A third name for a non-degenerate quadratic form is that of a \emph{regular quadratic form}.
