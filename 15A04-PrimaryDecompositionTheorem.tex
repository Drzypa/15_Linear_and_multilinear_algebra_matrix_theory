\begin{document}
This is an important theorem in linear algebra. It states the following:
Let $k$ be a field, $V$ a vector space over $k$, $\dim V =n$, and $T\colon V\to V$ a linear operator, such that its minimal polynomial (or its annihilator polynomial) is $m_{T}$, which decomposes in $k[X]$ into irreducible factors as $m_{T}=p_{1}^{\alpha_{1}} \ldots p_{r}^{\alpha_{r}}$. Then,
\begin{enumerate}
\item  $V=\bigoplus_{i=1}^{r}\ker (p_{i}^{\alpha_{i}}(T))$
\item $\ker (p_{i}^{\alpha_{i}}(T))$ is $T$-invariant for every $i$
\item If $T_{i}$ is the restriction of $T$ to $\ker (p_{i}^{\alpha_{i}}(T))$, then $m_{T_{i}}=p_{i}^{\alpha_{i}}$
\end{enumerate}

This is a consequence of a more general theorem:
Let $V$, $T$ be as above, and $f \in k[X]$ such that $f(T)=0$, with $f=f_{1} \ldots f_{r}$ and $(f_{i},f_{j})=1$ if $i \neq j$, then
\begin{enumerate}
\item $V=\bigoplus _{i=1}^{r}\ker(f_{i}(T))$
\item $\ker(f_{i}(T))$ is $T$-invariant for every $i$
\end{enumerate}

To illustrate its importance, the primary decomposition theorem, together with the cyclic decomposition theorem, imply the existence and uniqueness of the Jordan canonical form.
