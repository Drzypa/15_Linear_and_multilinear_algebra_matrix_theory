If $a$ and $b$ are linearly dependent, we write $\boldsymbol{b}=\lambda \boldsymbol{a}$. So we get:
$$\langle \boldsymbol{a},\lambda \boldsymbol{a}\rangle^2=\lambda^2\langle \boldsymbol{a},\boldsymbol{a}\rangle^2=\lambda^2 ||\boldsymbol{a}||^4=||\boldsymbol{a}||^2||\boldsymbol{b}||^2.$$
So we have equality if $\boldsymbol{a}$ and $\boldsymbol{b}$ are linearly dependent. In the other case we look at the quadratic function
$$||x\cdot \boldsymbol{a}+\boldsymbol{b}||^2=x^2||\boldsymbol{a}||^2+2x\langle\boldsymbol{a} ,\boldsymbol{b}\rangle + ||\boldsymbol{b}||^2.$$
This function is positive for every real $x$, if $\boldsymbol{a}$ and $\boldsymbol{b}$ are linearly independent. Thus it has no real zeroes, which means that
$$\langle\boldsymbol{a}, \boldsymbol{b}\rangle^2 - ||\boldsymbol{a}||^2 ||\boldsymbol{b}||^2$$
is always negative. So we have:
$$\langle\boldsymbol{a}, \boldsymbol{b}\rangle^2 < ||\boldsymbol{a}||^2||\boldsymbol{b}||^2,$$
which is the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality if $\boldsymbol{a}$ and $\boldsymbol{b}$ are linearly independent.
