\begin{document}
An $n\times n$ matrix $A$ is said to be a {\it reducible matrix} if and only if for some permutation matrix $P$, the matrix $P^TAP$ is block upper triangular.
If a square matrix is not reducible, it is said to be an {\it irreducible matrix}.  

The following conditions on an $n\times n$ matrix $A$ are equivalent.
\begin{enumerate}
\item
$A$ is an irreducible matrix.

\item
The digraph associated to $A$ is strongly connected.

\item
For each $i$ and $j$, there exists some $k$ such that $(A^k)_{ij}>0$.

\item
For any partition $J\sqcup K$ of the index set $\{1,2,\dots,n\}$, there exist $j\in J$ and $k\in K$ 
such that $a_{jk}\ne 0$.
\end{enumerate}

For certain applications, irreducible matrices are more useful than reducible matrices.  In particular, the Perron-Frobenius theorem gives more information about the spectra of irreducible matrices than of reducible matrices.
