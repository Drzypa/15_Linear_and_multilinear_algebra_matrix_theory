If $R$ is a division ring, then the \PMlinkname{direct sum}{DirectSum} of $n$ copies of $R$,
\[ R^n = R \oplus\dotsb\oplus R\text{  (n times),}\]
is a vector space.


The \emph{standard basis for $R^n$} consists of $n$ elements
\[ e_1 = (1,0,\dotsc ,0), \quad e_2 = (0,1,0,\dotsc ,0),\quad \dotsc \quad e_n = (0,\dotsc ,0,1) \]
where each $e_i$ has $1$ for its $i$th component and $0$ for every other component.  
The $e_i$ are called the \emph{standard basis vectors}.
