\begin{document}
Let $A$ be an $n \times n$ matrix over $\mathbb{R}$. 
A \emph{group inverse} for $A$ is an $n \times n$ matrix
$X$ such that
\begin{align}
AXA &= A \\
XAX &= X \\
AX &= XA.
\end{align}
Such a matrix, when it exists, is unique and is denoted by $A^{\#}$.
A group inverse is a special case of a Drazin inverse.
