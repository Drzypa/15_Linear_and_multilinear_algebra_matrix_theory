\begin{document}
All matrices in the below are complex $n\times n$ matrices.
\\Let $A$,$B$ be normal matrices, $AB=BA$. Then there exists a unitary matrix $Q$ such that \\
\begin{center}
$Q^HAQ = D_1$ ,\,$Q^HBQ=D_2$
\end{center}
where $^H$ is the conjugate transpose and $D_1, D_2$ are diagonal matrices.
