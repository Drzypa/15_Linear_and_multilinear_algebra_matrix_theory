\begin{document}
Let $\tilde{\lambda}$ be a complex number and $\tilde{u}$ be a vector with $ \Vert\tilde{u}\Vert _p = 1$, and let $r = A \tilde{u} - \tilde{\lambda} \tilde{u}$ (usually, $\tilde{\lambda}$ and $\tilde{u}$ are considered to be approximation of an eigenvalue and of an eigenvector of $A$).  Assume $A$ is diagonalizable and $A = XDX^{-1}$, with $D$ a diagonal matrix.  Then the matrix $A$ has an eigenvalue $\lambda$ which satisfies the inequality: 
\[
|\lambda - \tilde{\lambda}| \leq \kappa_p(X) \|r\|_p
\]
