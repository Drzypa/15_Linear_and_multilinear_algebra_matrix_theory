\begin{document}
Suppose that an $n\times n$ matrix $B$ is obtained by adding a
small-rank adjustment $XRY^T$ to matrix $A$,
\[
 B = A+XRY^T,
\]
where $X$ and $Y$ are $n\times r$ matrices, and $R$ is an $r\times
r$ matrix. Assume that the inverse of $A$ is known and $r$ is much
smaller than $n$. The following formula for $B^{-1}$ is often
useful,
\[
 B^{-1} = A^{-1} - A^{-1}X (R^{-1}+Y^TA^{-1}X)^{-1} Y^T A^{-1}
\]

provided that all inverses in the formula exist.

In particular, when $r=1$ and $A=I$, we have
\[
 (I+xy^T)^{-1} = I- \frac{xy^T}{1+y^Tx}
\]
for any $n\times 1$ column vectors $x$ and $y$ such that $1+y^Tx\neq
0$.
